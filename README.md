# 🏡 Predicting House Prices Using Advanced Regression Techniques

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using advanced regression techniques. It demonstrates the power of machine learning in real estate value estimation.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a structured dataset of housing information, we build and evaluate several regression models to accurately estimate home prices. The focus is on improving predictive performance with feature engineering, model tuning, and ensemble methods.

## 🧠 Goal

- Train advanced regression models for price prediction
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Compare multiple regression techniques
- Interpret model predictions and insights
